# pytorch-mnist-logisticRegression
The most basic PyTorch logistic regression model on MNIST - 70k images, only for the purpose of getting a saved PyTorch model object at the end and using it as part of an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to get its inference. 

- Trained only for 50 epochs
- Using SGD optimizer
- Optimized against cross entropy
- No hyperparameter tuning done, as increasing the accuracy is not the main purpose.
